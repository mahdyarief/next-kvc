# Feature 54

## Metadata
- **Category**: Feature
- **Objective**: Advanced feature explorer with top-level tabs and sub-feature grid for each active category.
- **Use Case**: Comprehensive platform capability walkthroughs (Task Management, Collaboration, Automation, Analytics, etc.), technical documentation, or multi-faceted product pages.
- **Visual Style**: "Multi-Layered Tab Hub" aesthetic. Centered `text-5xl` heading. `TabsList` with horizontal triggers on desktop. On mobile, tab selection switches to a custom circular pagination button row. Each `TabsContent`: Large `aspect-[1.67]` feature screenshot followed by a `grid-cols-3` row of sub-feature text blocks (title + description) for deep-dive detail.
- **Interactivity**: Client-side `useState` for mobile selection. Tab-switched content and sub-feature grid.
