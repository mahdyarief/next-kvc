# Vibe Blocks Skill

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Unique Asset**: This skill is a proprietary asset of the **Next Dashboard Starter Kit**. 
> It contains a massive library of **2,000+ production-grade components** curated from the best of **Relume Library (rl)** and **Shadcn/Custom blocks (cn)**.

A comprehensive library of **2,000+ UI components** from two curated sources, searchable from a single unified interface.

---

## Library Sources

The `library/` directory contains **two independent sub-libraries**, each with its own design language and category system:

| Source Key | Directory | Origin | Style | Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`rl`** | `library/rl/` | Relume Library | Semantic, prop-driven, clean composition | ~1,500 |
| **`cn`** | `library/cn/` | Custom / Shadcn | Visual-heavy, animation-rich, aceternity + magicui | ~1,388 |

> **Choose based on intent:**
> - Use **`rl`** for structured, semantic, CMS-driven UI (headers, footers, layouts, pricing).
> - Use **`cn`** for animation-first, visually rich UI (heroes, features, interactive showcases, aceternity components).

---

## Component Search (Token Optimized)

**ALWAYS** use the search script before reading files. This saves significant context window tokens.

### Search Across Both Sources (Default)
```bash
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py "query string"
```

### Search Within a Specific Source
```bash
# Relume library only
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py "query string" --source rl

# Custom/Shadcn library only
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py "query string" --source cn
```

### Control Results Count
```bash
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py "query string" --max-results 5
```

### List All Categories
```bash
# All sources
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py --list-categories

# Specific source
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py --list-categories --source rl
python .agent/skills/vibe-blocks/scripts/search.py --list-categories --source cn
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Search First**: Use the search script. Never browse files manually.
2. **Pick the Right Source**: Use `--source rl` for semantic/structural needs, `--source cn` for animation/wow-factor.
3. **Review Metadata**: Each result shows Category, Objective, Use Case, and Visual Style.
4. **Check Constraints**: Look for `framer-motion`, `aceternity`, or `magicui` dependencies in `cn` results — these require extra packages.
5. **Implementation**: Place components in appropriate feature folders per Feature-Based Architecture.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Reference, Not Gospel**: Source code is a *structural foundation*. Polish and adapt it to production standards.
2. **Objective-Driven**: Choose components based on user goals (Conversion, Awareness, Engagement).
3. **Aesthetic Excellence**: Follow the [Frontend Design Guidelines](../../rules/frontend-design.md). Avoid generic looks.
4. **Typography Mastery**:
   - **Headings**: Always apply `tracking-tight` to headings `text-4xl` and larger.
   - **Body**: Use `leading-relaxed` for readability on long-form text.
   - **Hierarchy**: Ensure clear contrast between H1, H2, and body text.
5. **Spacing & Breath**:
   - Increase padding (`py-16` → `py-24` or `py-32`) for hero sections.
   - Review grid gaps to ensure content isn't cramped.
6. **Motion-Enhanced**: Leverage Framer Motion for staggered reveals and smooth transitions.
7. **Responsive Integrity**: Ensure all patterns work from 320px to 1440px+.

---

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Search**: Find the pattern using the search script (both sources by default).
2. **Review**: Evaluate Category, Objective, Use Case suitability.
3. **Adapt (Source as Reference)**:
   - Copy the source code from `## Source Code`.
   - **Refactor Imports**: Replace generic imports with project-specific aliases (`@/components/ui`).
   - **Update Props**: Match actual data shape from Prisma Database queries or Next.js server actions.
4. **Polish (Mandatory)**:
   - **Typography**: Fix line-heights and letter-spacing.
   - **Colors**: Replace hardcoded colors with CSS variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`).
   - **Textures**: Add grain, gradients, or subtle borders.
   - **Safe Class Merging**: Always use the `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils`.
   - **Micro-Interactions**: Add hover states to all buttons and cards.
5. **Final Review**: Does it look **premium**? If it looks basic or generic, it is **not finished**.

## Source-Specific Notes

### Relume (`rl`) — Structural Patterns
- Uses a `Props` + `Defaults` pattern for typed, reusable components.
- Imports from `@/components/ui` (Shadcn primitives).
- No animation dependencies by default.
- Best for: semantic HTML structure, content-driven marketing pages.

### Custom/Shadcn (`cn`) — Visual Premium
- Uses `interface ComponentProps` with `className?: string` (cn-utility compatible).
- May depend on: `framer-motion`, `motion/react`, `@/components/aceternity/*`, `@/components/magicui/*`.
- Heavily uses `useScroll`, `useTransform`, `AnimatePresence` for scroll-driven animations.
- Best for: landing pages, interactive showcases, wow-factor sections.
